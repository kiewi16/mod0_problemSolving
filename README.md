Problem Solving Example
Pretend your assignment is to write a function or method that accepts an array as an argument and returns a number representing the number of elements in the array. Below is one way you might use the 8 steps to Problem Solving:

Restate the goal.
"Write a function/method that counts how many elements are in an array."
Consider the data.
"The parameter is an array and the return value is a number."
Ask clarifying questions.
"Are there any existing methods that can count the length of an array?"
Break it down.
"Write a function/method. The parameter is an array. Call a method on the array to find its length. Return the length of the array. Call the function with a couple of test arrays to check the result."
Research.
You might Google something like "JavaScript/Ruby method array length"
Start coding.
Remember to call your function/method using a couple of different values to confirm your solution is behaving as expected.
Stuck?
This is a great opportunity to use what you learned about Asking Technical Questions!
Refactor.
Try asking yourself, "Can I solve this in a simpler way?" or "Is there a different method I can use to get the same result?"
A Note About Research
While we’ve all used Google a time or two, there are ways to make your search more effective. Follow the guidelines below to ensure you get the best possible results.

Include the programming language
Include the data type (if applicable)
Use technical terms
Choose reliable sources (MDN or Ruby docs)
If the solution you’re looking for isn’t in the first two pages of results, it’s probably not there. You might try reframing your search terms or use another resource, like your Turing community!

Problem Solving in Action
Open up a new replit to complete the following challenges. Don’t get too caught up in finding the solution - focus instead on your PROCESS. Push yourself to slow down and follow the process outlined above. And remember that you can post questions in Slack if you hit blockers!

Challenge 1
Write a method or function that accepts a string. The method or function should return a boolean that describes whether or not the string has an even number of characters.



Challenge 2
Update your previous method or function so it accepts an array. The method or function should return a boolean that describes whether or not the array's length is an even number.

Reflect
Before continuing, take some time to reflect on the following questions.

What do you like about this process?
What might make this process challenging?
Are there any steps you would add or modify?
Challenge 3
Write a method or function that accepts a number from 1-24 that represents the current time rounted to the closest hour in 24-hour military time. (i.e. 11 = 11:00 AM, 16 = 4:00 PM). The function should return a different greeting based on the time of day.

4 AM - 11 AM: Good morning!
12 PM - 4 PM: Good afternoon!
5 PM - 8PM: Good evening!
9 PM - 3 AM: Good night!
